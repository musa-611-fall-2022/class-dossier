        <p>I'm an experiential graphic designer shifting into public policy communication, motivated by housing justice issues in the US. I first studied Graphic Communication Design at the University of Cincinnati and worked at BHDP Architecture and Arrowstreet Architecture & Design during my undergrad. My interest in housing began when working at in Boston and hearing my coworkers' stories of tumultuous community hearings. This exposure led to my capstone project where I studied the Atlantic Yards housing development in Brooklyn, NYC and collaborated on a pop-up exhibit about it with local journalist Norman Oder. We still maintain one key map graphic from that project to inform New Yorkers about the development.</p>  

        <p>From 2017 to a month ago I've been working at G&A, an experience design firm in Washington DC. I've been working to create impactful visitor experiences for natural history and state history museums, sport centers like the US Olympic and Paralympic Museum, and soon-to-open Congress exhibit at the US Capitol Visitors Center in DC. I've also freelanced as a UX/UI designer for various firms and start ups.</p>

        <p>While working in DC, I volunteered for a couple housing organizations that educated me about local government, planning, and housing policy. A team of us often shared educational DC housing presentations to church communities, discussing current issues and DC's housing history. Continuing this learning, my goal during this year in MUSA is to advance my skills in communication and analysis tools and better understand how to address our country's current housing crisis.</p>

  <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p> My favorite parts of my exhibit design career were creating accessible experiences for visitors of all abilities and making maps and infographics to communicate complex stories. I love when a complex graphic is elegantly welcoming.</p>
        <p>I love board games and always have ideas for making a couple. This interest in interaction design is a large part of why I want to develop my JavaScript capabilities. We can do so much digitally that's harder to accomplish in print!</p>
