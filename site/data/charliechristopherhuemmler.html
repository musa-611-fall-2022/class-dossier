        <h2>My Experiences</h2>
       
        <!-- 1. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
                graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
                volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
              <p> 
                Before the MUSA program, I studied at Colgate University, majoring in Mathematical Economics. The econometrics courses in this major, along with electives in GIS and data vizualization, entered me into this world of spatial data science, and I am excited to continue it at Penn.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduating in 2020, I’ve worked in the logistics industry as a delivery driver for Amazon and as a delivery cyclist for the Philly startup The Rounds. I enjoyed this work as I was interacting with spatial softwares and exploring the built environment, but knew it was temporary.

              <p>
                Since moving to Philly in fall 2021 I have been engaged civically, volunteering with the Fishtown Neighbors Association and advocating for better bicycle infrastructure and public transit with the politcal action committee 5th Square. Over the summer I interned in the City Controller’s office and hope to continue working for the City of Philadelphia once I graduate.

                I am excited to learn how to make interactive web dashboards in this class. I want to be able to present information in an understandable fashion so everyone is able to learn and make informed decisions from it.

        <h2>My Sports</h2>
              <p> I like to play non-traditional sports, namely disc golf and bike polo. 
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bike polo is played 3v3 on a hockey court, using mallets to shoot a ball into a goal. If your foot touches the ground, you must tap back in at center court. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Living in Philly I have easy access to one of the oldest disc gold courses in the world, Sedgley Woods. Disc golf is very similar to ball golf, but using a disc and basket instead.
                </p>
               <p>
                Also, I am a huge fan esports, particularly League of Legends, with Cloud9 being my favorite team.
