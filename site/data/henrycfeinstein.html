  <h2>My Experiences</h2>

  <!-- 1. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
          graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
          volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
  <p>In college, I majored in political pcience and minored in computer science. I focused on American politics with a particular interest in public policy and law, and spent some time working in Mayor Jim Kenney's policy office. After graduating, I worked for the <a href="https://ourpublicservice.org/">Partnership for Public Service</a>, a non-profit organization in Washington, D.C. which provides leadership development training to federal employees and advocates for improvements to how people are managed and hired into government. Although I initially tried to pursue this traditional policy career after graduation, it was this combined interest in government and technology that led me to eventually come back for my planning degree; I found myself missing local government and opportunities to code. So here I am, focusing on how data science can be applied in municipal governments and hoping to work for Philadelphia again after graduation.</p>

  <h2>My Interests</h2>

  <!-- 2. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph element
          (or two) below. -->
  <p>As a Smart Cities concentrator within the MCP program, I am most interested in the effective use of data in government operations. In my time as a program evaluation specialist in D.C., I saw that the main barrier to proper data use was a lack of clear communication and literacy around quantitative methods. I hope that this class will helpe me become a better data communicator through the use of accessible tools to visualize and interact with data so that I can act as a bridge between technical experts and policymakers in my future career.</p>

  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of class, I have many hobbies--probably too many to actually do them all! I am an avid musician, having played classical violin for almost 20 years along with several other stringed instruments including the mandolin and electric bass. I am also an avid cyclist, and I love bowling and birdwatching.</p>
