              I had generalist's education in the urban planning field, jumping among design, research, and analytics.
              I am shifting my focus more towards urban analytics, visualization, and tool-making.

              I taught myself HTML and CSS and made a static portfolio website for myself.
              JavaScript has been the missing piece. With this new skill, I hope to be able to
              make interactive user interfaces for planning tools and public engagement.
