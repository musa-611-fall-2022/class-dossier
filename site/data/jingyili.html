          <p>
          	I am a second-year graduate student of historic preservation at Weitzman School of Design at Penn. I had my bachelor degree in architecture and I grew a strong interest in coding since my first semester here.

          	I took MUSA611 last semester and I was able to use what I learned in this course during my summer internship. 

          	Apart from web programming, I am also interested in machine learning and software design and would like to keep exploring in the intersection between the built environment and digital technologies.
