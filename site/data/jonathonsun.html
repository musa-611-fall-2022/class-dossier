  <h2>My Experiences</h2>
  <p> I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D student studying Higher Education. I earned my master's degree at the University of Missouri in Education Leadership and Policy Analysis with an emphasis in Student Affairs. I earned my bachelor's degree at THE Ohio State University in Sociology with a minor in Chinese.</p>

  <p> I am currently working towards my qualifying exams, so I'm in the process of consolidating all of my literature and trying to narrow down my topic of Asian American college access particularly with a geographic lens on how environments shape college access I've been trying to volunteer with multiple Asian American organizations around Philly. Last year I volunteered with Vietlead in their community engagement role, and over the summer I helped with lunch prep for Asian Americans United. </p>

  <h2>My Interests</h2>

  <p> I'm really excited to learn more about making really nice interfaces for people to engage data. Although I can use plotly with R I know that a lot of the R packages that make nice interactive data visualization actually use D3 to make the visualizations. Rather than going through plotly, I would rather use D3 to make some really nice interfaces

  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
  <p> I really enjoy the musical arts. I was classically trained as a pianist for 13 years. In college I continued to practice piano; in addition to practicing singing and vocal percussion. I've included the culmination of those skills in my tedxtalk</p>
