  <h2>My Experiences</h2>

        <p>
        Professionally, and academically, I have always been a designer. From 2015 to 2019, 
        I went to the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, RI (lovely city!) where I studied
        Industrial Design. Although physical craft was the primary course of study in my department,
        I tended to gravitate towards the digital - my prototypes were shoddy while my slide decks sparkled. <br><br>

        On either side of my senior year, I completed fellowships in planning / planning-adjacent city departments: In 2018
        as a Communication Design Fellow with the Providence Department of Planning and Development, and in 2019 as a Summer 
        Fellow in the Boston Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics. It was in the booming brutalist halls of Boston City Hall
        that I fell in love with all things civic, and decided to eventually pursue a graduate degree to find my way back to 
        some city hall somewhere. <br><br>

        Unfortunately, a certain global event put my plans on hold, and I paid the bills in the meantime through freelance graphic
        and web design. Coasting off a month-long web design course taken at RISD, I mainly stayed on the surface-level of sites - 
        branding, accessibility, building and customizing Squarespace and Wordpress sites. All important work, but I itched to get into 
        the "meat" of that work - doing the research and analysis, building the tools, and guiding the course of work. Cue a re-opening
        of the world, a slew of graduate school applications, and my finding my new home in Philadelphia and the start of a new chapter 
        of my life!

        <p>
        Short answer: I want to learn how to make <a href= "https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964">scrollytellies</a>
        <br><br>
        More specifically, this means I want to learn how to process data to be displayed on the web, learn 
        compelling methods of visualizing that data, and then make it accessible and interactive across a variety of web platforms. 
        <br><br>
        Web-scraping tools and in-browser generative art would also be fun.
