        <p>
             Hi. My name is Minwook Kang, Min. From Seoul, South Korea, it's my first time to be here in US. My major was Architecture and also I have Architect license of Korea, which
             means that I can run my own company in Korea. I served at the Air force for three years just after graduated from my university. 
             After then, as an urban researcher, I worked for three years in Seoul and had conducted sevral interesting reseach works, especailly as an
             Architect point of views. Last research work is now on exhibition at the Seoul Hall of Urbanism and Architecture
             (https://sca.seoul.go.kr/seoulhour/site/urbanArch/exhibition/exhibitNow/624).
             I have an experience of studying in Paris for a half an year and working at Shigeru Ban Architect's Tokyo office as an intership. chaneg
