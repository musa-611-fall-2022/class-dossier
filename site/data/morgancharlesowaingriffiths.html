<p> I am a second year MCP student concentrating in Housing, Community, and Economic Development. Prior to coming to Penn, I got my bachelor&apos;s degree in Cultural Anthropology and Urban Studies from Tufts University and worked for a few years in farmers market management, food service, and historic preservation outreach.</p>

<p> Currently, I am an intern in the Smart Growth Office at the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission here in Philadelphia.</p>

<p> Broadly, my interests include the relationship between place, identity, and history; food justice and urban agriculture; housing justice; and participatory planning. </p>

<p> Outside of academics, I am a member of <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/pennhousing4all/">Penn Housing 4 All</a> and I volunteer with the <a href = "https://www.phillyorchards.org"> Philadelphia Orchard Project</a>.</p>

   <p> I&apos;m interested in JavaScript and web design as a tool for community engagement, participatory planning, and storytelling. I also don&apos;t know a lot about coding in general and would love to start learning more, so this class is my gateway into the coding world. </p>
