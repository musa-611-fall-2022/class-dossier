<p> I received my B.A. in Economics from Seattle University and came straight to Penn for the Master of City Planning program. In a community development course from undergrad I learned about ethnic enclaves and particularly Filipinotown. Ever since then, I've been interested in community economic development and placemaking in immigrant communities. </p>

<p> I worked in a number of different areas within the realm of planning including land use, affordable housing, placemaking, economic development, and currently, in transportation with Alta Planning + Design. </p>

  <!-- 2. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph element
          (or two) below. -->
<p> In this course I hope to learn about how javascript visualizations can be used as a tool for community engagement to create a more dynamic and collaborative planning process. </p>

<p> I believe that the traditional approach to garnering community input through stickies on a map is extremely static and limiting. Especially with the impacts of COVID-19, virtual engagement is necessary and this is where I think javascript can fill that gap. </p>
