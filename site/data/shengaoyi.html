	<p>
		I am a graduate student of MUSA. My undergraduate major is Geospatial Information Engineering (Smart Cities).

		I took the similar courses WebGIS and Data Visualization in my junior year, so I am familiar with Javascript, html, css and so on.

		I've participated some competitions which required websites to show the results, so that equipped me with little full-stack knowledge, like React.js, Deck.gl, Mapbox and Flask.

		Apart from web programming, I am also interested in machine learning and software design and would like to keep exploring in the intersection between the built environment and digital technologies.
