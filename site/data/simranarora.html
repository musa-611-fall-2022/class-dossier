          <p>Hello. I consider myself a designer who is now exploring realm of urban technology.
                I studied architecture for my undergraduate degree, during which my interests in urban design and city planning grew.
                After graduation, I worked as an urban designer in Mumbai for three years, while also receiving a fellowship from a social sciences institute to study /'urban voids/' in the city.</p>

                <p>I have work experience in architectural writing, landscape architecture, developing mixed-used masterplans and university planning. At Penn, I am concentrating in Transportation Planning,
                and my interests are in GIS and learning more about geospatial data science. </p>

  <!-- 2. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph element
          (or two) below. -->
          <p>My first exposure to data, and specifically to geospatial data, was in my first semester at grad school. It opened up and entirely new world to me, and my pivoted my focus from design towards data.
                Through this course, I hope to learn how to present my work in an interactive, fun and professional way. As a former architect, I want to use my design eye to make data readable and create insights that are useful.
