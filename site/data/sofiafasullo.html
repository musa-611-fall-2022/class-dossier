  <h2>My Experiences</h2>

       <h3>In my undergrad I was a statistics and GIS major. I  
        was very interested in using GIS  and data science 
        for social justice in planning. I learned to code in
        R and python and I learned to conduct a statistical
        analysis and a spatial analysis in ESRI products.</h3>

  <h2>My Interests</h2>

  <h3> I hope to learn how to code in Java from this course, and I hope
                to get a hang of creating web pages. I also would like to 
                get more familiar with html and understand in general what
                coding languages can and cannot do. </h3>
