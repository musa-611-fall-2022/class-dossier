  <p>I started my career as an <strong>architect</strong> and an enthusiast about urban studies which drived me to pursue a degree in city planning. Apart from working as an architect, I also worked for a healthcare marketing company as a client engagement manager. Over the past year I developed an inclination towards <strong>data analytics</strong>. During the summer of 2022 I worked for <strong>Texas Transportation Institute</strong> in the realm of big data in transportation.</p>

  <p>Apart from the analytics, it is important to learn how that information is being represented to the user in an interactive manner. I do not have a tech background, however I have been learning programming languages such as Python and R as a tool to study data science and I see this course as a supplement to it.   </p>
