          <p style="text-align:left" >I studied Civil and Environmental Engineering at
        University of California, Davis. I had some experience in python programming and MATLAB. I also
        took several classes that involve using ArcGIS, so I am somewhat familiar with mapping application.
        But last time I went to school was two years ago.
