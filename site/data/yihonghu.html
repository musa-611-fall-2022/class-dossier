  <p>As I lived in China, Tanzania, and Kenya, I enjoyed eating coconut rice with my neighbors in Tanzania, learning to cook Mandazi with my host family in Kibwezi village in Kenya, and wearing the sweater hand-knitted by my neighbor who watched me growing up in China. Because of these experiences with close communities, I sought to invest in the communities surrounding me in Chicago, to explore the unique relationship between place and people in the new, yet familiar city near my college.</p>

  <p>During my time studying, interning, and later working with grassroots organizations in the city, I observed a new perspective on human flourishing that is grounded in relationship-building as an answer to socioeconomic and environmental brokenness: flourishing relationships between neighbors and places that motivate citizens to be empathetic and involved in the overall well-being of their communities. I believe being an urban planner is the most concrete way to strengthen and restore these relationships.</p>
                  
  <p>As an urban planner, I am interested in <strong>merging data and policymaking</strong> together to build cities' resilience against the most pressing global challenges today. I am also a strong advocate for <strong>community empowerment, non-motorzied mobility, and public space activation.</strong></p>
