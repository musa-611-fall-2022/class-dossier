        I am a first-year graduate student of Master of Urban Spatial Analytics at Weitzman School of Design at Penn. I had my bachelor degree in urban and rural planning at Peking University at Beijing. 

        Before this class, I have no experience in JavaScript or web programming at all, but I learnt some coding in Python and did a research program in text sentimental analytics by Python. Hope this can help me a littile in JS learning.
