<p>I graduated as an architecture student in China. During my undergraduate study, I&apos;ve made some urban design projects as well as conducted some urban researches which aroused my interests in urban studies. Then I joined a urban-study workshop <a href="https://www.gooood.cn/under-35-ddh.htm?lang=en">DiDuHui</a> in my hometown, Beijing, as a contracted author. I participated in book publishing and streaming media promotion, and completed the description of my hometown, Beijing&apos;s city intentions. 
<p>I&apos;ve also worked as an intern architect and a curator a year ago. I participated in university campus design and exhibition curation. After that, I thought I should learn something more rational, so I applied for MUSA program.  </p>

   <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
   <p>I like to go to museums, especially those art and history museums. So on weekends, I often visit some exhibitions with my friends. In addition, I also enjoy participating in some social activities and making new friends. According to <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">MBTI Test</a>, I&apos;m close to ESFJ, an extroverted personality, so it&apos;s not hard to explain why I am an socialist. </p>
