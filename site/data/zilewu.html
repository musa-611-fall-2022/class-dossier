                I am a first-year graduate student of MUSA program at Weitzman School of Design at Penn. I had my bachelor degree in architecture. 
                Before MUSA-611, I had almost no programming experience. 
                However, after the first class experience, I think programming is a very interesting subject, and I hope I can make more progress in this semester.

                I would like to learn how to make my own red pages and I would also like to learn how to visualize my research on the web.
                I also want to learn how to make some web-based apps to help ordinary people understand and learn about our city.

                I was a band drummer in college. Don't be surprised, I can really play the drums. (Although I haven't played in a long time LOL)
                 My band played at major live houses in Shanghai and we stood on stage and shared our music with others. It was a very nostalgic time.
