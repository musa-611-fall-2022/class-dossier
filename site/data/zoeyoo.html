        <!-- 1. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
                graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
                volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
        <p>
                For my undergraduate education, I attended the University of California, Berkeley between the years of
                2016 and 2020. I majored in Sustainable Environmental Design, within the College of Environmental
                Design, with minors in GIS and Urban Planning. Though I originally meant to study with more of a focus
                on environmental studies, I found my passions lay in geospatial analysis and urban planning; in
                particular, transportation planning and advocacy. So, I decided to attend graduate school for Urban
                Planning, studying Sustainable Transportation and Infrastructure Planning (STIP).
                As I only took one year between my undergraduate and graduate programs, I have not had significant work
                experience in planning. At UC Berkeley, I worked for two years at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology,
                mapping the geographic extents of amphibian species; this included frogs, salamanders, and caecilians
                (little wormlike creatures). I loved learning about these vibrant creatures and exploring the Bay Area
                with friends to find what reptiles and amphibians we could find (this is called "herping").
                My other most relevant job so far has been in the City of Philadelphia's Office of Transportation,
                Infrastructure, and Sustainability (oTIS), where I have worked both on transit and bicycle
                infrastructure analysis and outreach.

                My interests in this class are towards building websites both for my professional and recreational
                interests. First and foremost, I would like to establish my online portfolio to showcase some of the
                work I have done in my undergraduate and graduate education. Website building is also an invaluable
                skill in relation to urban planning and advocacy, especially in the (post-) COVID era, and building
                better websites can help us reach more people and (ideally) reduce frustration with local government
                processes.
                Furthermore, I am interested in building websites for fun! Some of my hobbies include art, music, video
                editing, and graphic design.

        <h2>My Favorite Way to Make Fried Rice</h2>
        <p>
                I have gotten better at making fried rice as of recently. I'm not a fantastic cook, but can manage with
                day-old rice to make something lovely (it *has* to be day-old). Using my a big ol wok, first transform a
                few eggs into a slightly undercooked omelet, which then goes on a plate for later. With a clean wok,
                throw in onion, bell pepper, then frozen peas and carrots, or whatever veggies you desire; don't forget
                to use plenty of oil. Cook these on high heat, and once the veggies are sizzling, dump in the rice and
                break it up til the grains are mostly separated. When the rice has heated up a little, add the
                ingredients that make the rice turn that beautiful golden-brown color and taste amazing: some oyster
                sauce, MSG, salt, pepper, dark soy sauce, and Shaoxing wine if you have it. Mix thoroughly, and just
                after turning off the heat, stir in toasted sesame oil to make your stomach scream at you. Lastly, top
                with green onions and a squiggle of Sriracha. Voila, fuel for another night of coding.
